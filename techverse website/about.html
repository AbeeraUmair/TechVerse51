            <p class="text-base leading-relaxed">Why did Techverse51 choose its name?
                The name Techverse51 has a unique history. A group of students enrolled in the PIAIC program, which ends
                with the number 51, decided to name their platform after this number. The number 51 is widely recognized
                for many reasons, often considered a symbol of danger, tirelessness, and passion.</p>
            <p class="text-base leading-relaxed">The name "Techverse" was inspired by the concept of a universe. The
                idea was to create a platform where all things tech-related could come together in one unified space,
                hence "Techverse." The combination of these elements reflects the platform's mission to be a
                comprehensive hub for technology and learning.</p>

        <section class="mb-10">
            <h2 class="text-3xl font-medium text-white mb-4">The Story Behind the Creation of Techverse51</h2>
            <p class="text-base leading-relaxed">What inspired the creation of this platform, and how did it start?</p>
            <p class="text-base leading-relaxed">The story behind the creation of this platform is driven by a deep
                passion for learning programming languages. It all started with an individual who struggled to write
                "Hello World" in a programming language. Her frustration and sense of isolation sparked a dream: a place
                where everyone could learn without fear or judgment.</p>
            <p class="text-base leading-relaxed">She envisioned a peaceful, helpful, and comfortable space where anyone
                could start learning programming languages. A place where basic questions were encouraged, and the
                environment was non-judgmental and supportive. She imagined a community where people respected each
                other's knowledge levels and where the more skilled would help mentor those who were just starting out.
            </p>
            <p class="text-base leading-relaxed">Her dream was to create an ideal learning platform where everyone,
                regardless of their starting point, could learn technology in a nurturing and supportive environment.
                This vision, born out of personal struggle and hope for a better learning experience, led to the
                creation of Techverse51.</p>
